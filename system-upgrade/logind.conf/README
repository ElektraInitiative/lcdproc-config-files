removal of one config: so it reverts back to default

This was, at it later turned out, a misconfiguration.

The option HandleLidSwitch=ignore was essential, because
otherwise the computer goes to sleep after reboot
(it is a laptop, always closed, used as server).

Merging should actually automatically come up with the
correct result. It would have avoid the misconfiguration
because of my wrong manual merging.
